# Opal Rails

_Rails (3.2+) bindings for [Opal JS](http://opalrb.org) engine._


## Installation

In your `Gemfile`

``` ruby
gem 'opal-rails'
```


## Usage

### Asset Pipeline

``` js
// app/assets/application.js

// The Opal runtime
// = require opal
//
// Dom manipulation
// = require opal-dom
```

and then just use the `.rb` or `.opal` extensions:

```ruby
# app/assets/javascripts/hi-world.js.rb

puts "G'day world!"
```



### As a template

You can use it for your dynamic templates too (Probably in conjunction with ERB to pass dynamic state)

```ruby
# app/views/posts/show.js.opal.erb

Element.id('<%= dom_id @post %>').show
```


### As an Haml filter (optional)

Of course you need to require `haml-rails` separately since its presence is not assumed

```haml
-# app/views/posts/show.html.haml

%article= post.body

%a#show-comments Display Comments!

.comments(style="display:none;")
  - post.comments.each do |comment|
    .comment= comment.body

:opal
  Document.ready? do
    Element.id('show-comments').on :click do
      Element.find('.comments').first.show
      false # aka preventDefault
    end
  end
```


### Spec!

Add a `spec.js` into `assets/javascripts` to require your specs

```js
// = require_tree ./spec
```

and then a spec folder with you specs!

```ruby
# assets/javascripts/spec/example_spec.js.rb

describe 'a spec' do
  it 'has successful examples' do
    'I run'.should =~ /run/
  end
end
```

Then visit `/opal_spec` from your app and **reload at will**.
